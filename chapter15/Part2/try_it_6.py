# #15-6. Two D8s: Create a simulation showing what happens when you roll two 
# eight-sided dice 1,000 times. Try to picture what you think the visualization will 
# look like before you run the simulation, then see if your intuition was correct. 
# Gradually increase the number of rolls until you start to see the limits of your 
# systemâ€™s capabilities.
